# Everything you thought you know is wrong

## Drupal is not a content management system

## Drupal is software to build content management systems

## Congratulations, you just became a software developer

# Complexity

- Sources of complexity are different
- TODO: Graph of data about different distros
- Complexity is tied directly to maintainability

# Architecture

- https://imgflip.com/i/ksioq
- Mainly Defined by Module Selection
- How to select modules
  - TODO find slide from older how contrib works pres
- Panels
  - a new display layer
  - a new data structure
  - new visibility system
- Display Suite

# Documentation
- http://www.datamation.com/imagesvr_ce/2135/art-programming.jpg
- No free passes here, you must document what you do and why you did it
- editing taxonomy image here
- editing content type image here
- Naming conventions as important in site building as they are in code
  - And these often end up getting used in code!

# Data Structures
- "There are only two hard problems in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton
- TODO: Comparison images of how software engineers and site builders think about data

## The Old Guard
- Content Types
- Fields
- Taxonomies
- Menus

## The Upstarts
- Reference Fields (Entity or otherwise)
- Field Collections
- Field Groups
- Flag
- Nodequeue / Draggable Views
