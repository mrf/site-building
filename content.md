# Everything you thought you know is wrong

## Drupal is not a content management system

## Drupal is software to build content management systems

## Congratulations, you just became a software developer

# Complexity
- (https://brucelynnblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/dilbert-complexity.jpg)
- Complexity means a lot of different things in site building
- TODO: Graph of data about different distros
- Complexity is tied directly to maintainability

# Architecture
- (http://www.90percentofeverything.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/1890stripprint.gif)
- Your Architecture is defined by Module Selection
- (https://imgflip.com/i/ksioq)
- How to select modules
  - TODO find screenshots of relevant sections of module screen (downloaded/ instlaled/ maintainer/ recent commits) from my how contrib works pres
- Panels
  - a new display layer
  - several new data structures
  - new visibility system
- Display Suite
- Views
  - configurable visibility rules for views data
- To template or not to template

# Documentation
- http://www.datamation.com/imagesvr_ce/2135/art-programming.jpg
- No free passes for site builders, you must document what you do and why you did it
- editing taxonomy image here
- editing content type image here

# Data Structures
- "There are only two hard problems in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton
- Naming conventions as important in site building as they are in code
  - And these often end up getting used in code!
- TODO: Comparison images of how software engineers and site builders think about data

## The Old Guard
- Content Types
- Fields
- Taxonomies
- Menus

## The Upstarts
- Reference Fields (Entity or otherwise)
- Field Collections
- Field Groups
- Flag
- Nodequeue / Draggable Views

## Conclusion
- All decisions get made deliberately
- Documentation is just as important
- Never introduce complexity on a whim
